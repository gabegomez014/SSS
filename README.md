This a project started within my Computer Science 205 class at Bucknell University. 

The github links to the people who helped me with this project can be found below. 

For this project, I am trying to make the model more and more life like. I plan to soon involve threading in order to show proper velocity of planets as they go around the sun, iterate and show how many days/months/years have gone by for each planet within the simulation and much more.

If you have any ideas, please work on them and add them to the program as you see fit. Literally anything that can make the system more true to actual physics is greatly appreciated. 

Also, CSS and styling is also huge, and definitely not to be taken lightly when expanding upon this program as well. Ideally, I would like this solar system to be one of the best in terms of being visually appealing, but also accurate when it comes to information. 

With that, thank you for any and all contributions to the project. 

If there are ever any questions, you can email me at gag014@bucknell.edu.
