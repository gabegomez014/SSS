This a project started within my Computer Science 205 class at Bucknell University. 

In order for it to properly run as an exectuable, I suggest following one of the two links I will put below if you do not already know how to create a jar file, or simply use the jar file I have provided.

Building jar as specified by Java: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/build.html
Building jar through NetBeans: https://netbeans.org/kb/articles/javase-deploy.html

Once you have the jar file, make sure that the file is in the same directory as the src directory before running.

In this project, you see all of the planets within our solar system revolving around the sun in a similar model to our current solar system. It takes information of each planet like periapsis, apoapsis, mass and more, and uses certain given information in order to figure out other pieces of information of the planet. 

You have the ability to zoom in and out by hitting the keys I and O (respectively) and translate in 4 directions by using W, A, S or D. If you ever lose the center on the system, you can hit R, and it'll reset the system back to the original starting position (will not zoom in or out for you though).

If there are ever any questions, you can email me at gag014@bucknell.edu.
